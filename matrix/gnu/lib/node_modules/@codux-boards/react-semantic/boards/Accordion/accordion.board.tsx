                                Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from
                                pet shops, private owners, or shelters.

                                A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog
                                from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and
                                upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly,
                                finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who
                                may not find one so readily.
